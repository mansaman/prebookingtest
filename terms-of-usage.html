The Receiver may disclose Confidential Information of the Discloser if so required pursuant to a regulation, law, subpoena, or court order (collectively, “Mandatory Disclosures”), provided the Receiver gives the Discloser notice of a Mandatory Disclosure (to the extent legally permitted). The Discloser will cover the Receiver’s reasonable legal fees for preparation of witnesses, deposition, and testimony to the extent such Mandatory Disclosure is in connection with a lawsuit or legal proceeding to which the Discloser is a party or to the extent fees are incurred in connection with reasonable assistance provided to the Discloser in connection with the Discloser’s efforts to contest such Mandatory Disclosure.</div>
    <br/>
    <div>16.7 Injunctive Relief. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that no adequate remedy may exist at law for an actual or threatened breach of this section 15 and that, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this section 15, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it.</div>

    <div>a) the indemnified party (“Indemnified Party”) will promptly notify the indemnifying party (“Indemnifying Party”) of any claim; provided, however, any failure to give such prompt notice will not relieve Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this section 17 except to the extent that Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure;</div>
    <div>b) Indemnifying Party will have the sole and exclusive authority to defend or settle any claim; and</div>
    <div>c) Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with Indemnifying Party in connection with Indemnifying Party’s activities under this section 17 at Indemnifying Party’s expense.

<div><b>21. Duration, Termination, and Survival</b></div>
<div>21.1 Duration. These Terms, as may be updated from time to time, will commence on the date they are accepted by you when you use our Services and continue until terminated under Section 20.2 (Termination) (“Duration”).</div>
<div>21.2 Termination for Convenience. Either party may terminate these Terms and close all of your accounts for any reason upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if there is a Quotation(s) in effect, then these Terms will not terminate until such Quotation(s) has expired or been terminated under its terms.</div>
<br/>
<div>21.3 Termination for Cause. We, at our sole discretion, may terminate these Terms and close all of your accounts in the event you commit any material breach of these Terms (which includes but is not limited to your payment obligations under section 13) and fail to remedy such material breach within fifteen (15) days after we provide written notice of such breach to you.</div>
<br/>
<div>21.4 Termination for Insolvency.

<br/>
<div><b>22. General</b></div>
<div>22.1 No Waiver and Order of Precedence. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or enforcing any provision under these Terms will constitute a waiver of that right, provision, or any other provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by each party to be legally binding. Titles and headings of sections of these Terms are for convenience only and will not affect the construction of any provision of these Terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence will be: (1) the applicable Quotation, (2) these Terms, (3) our Acceptable Use Policy and (4) the applicable Documentation.</div>
<br/>
<div>22.2 Assignment. You will not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms will be null and void. We may assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without your consent. Subject to this section 21.2, these Terms will be binding on each party and each party’s successors and permitted assigns.</div>
<br/>
<div>22.3 No partnership. Each party is an independent contractor in the performance of their respective obligations under these Terms. Nothing in these Terms is intended to create or will be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship or a partnership, agency, joint venture, or franchise. Each party will be solely responsible for all of its respective employees and agents and its respective labour costs and expenses arising in connection with its respective employees and agents. Each party will also be solely responsible for all claims, liabilities, damages, or debts of any type that may arise on account of each of its respective activities, or those of its respective employees and agents, in the performance of these Terms. Neither party has the authority to commit the other party in any way and will not attempt to do so or imply that it has the right to do so.</div>
<br/>
<div>22.4 Severability. Except as described in section 23 (Governing Law and Alternative Dispute Resolution), if any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, that provision will be amended or removed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and the rest of the unaffected Terms will continue in full force and effect.</div>

<br/>
<div>22.8 Force Majeure. No failure, delay, or default in performance of any obligation of a party will constitute an event of default or breach of these Terms to the extent that such failure to perform, delay, or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control and without negligence of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil, or military authority, fire, strike, lockout, or other labour dispute, flood, terrorist act, war, riot, theft, earthquake, epidemic, pandemic or other natural disaster.

<br/>
<div><b>23. Governing Law and Alternative Dispute Resolution</b></div>
<div>23.1 Wait! Before issuing a legal notice or initiating legal action against us, we strongly encourage you to contact our Customer Support team at <a href="mailto:support@foodmarkethub.com">support@foodmarkethub.com</a> or call them at +6018-3692661. Most disputes can be resolved that way in a friendly and fuss-free way.</div>
<br/>
<div>23.2 Good Faith Discussions and Negotiation. In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination (the Dispute) which cannot be resolved as per section 23.1, both of us will first attempt to resolve the Dispute by negotiation in good faith between our appointed representatives (the Negotiation).</div>
<br/>
<div>23.3 Arbitration. If the Dispute remains unresolved within thirty (30) days of the start of any Negotiation, either of us is entitled to refer the Dispute for final resolution to arbitration administered by the Asian International Arbitration Centre (AIAC) under the Arbitration Rules of the AIAC for the time being in force (the AIAC Rules), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference to this section 23.3. Unless both of us unanimously agree otherwise, the arbitral tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators to be appointed under the AIAC Rules. The language of arbitration shall be English. The seat of arbitration shall be Malaysia. All awards may, if necessary, be enforced by any court having jurisdiction in the same manner as a judgment in such court. The costs of such arbitration shall be determined by and allocated between both of us by the arbitration tribunal in its award.</div>
<br/>
<div>23.4 Governing Law</div>
<div>These Terms, their subject matter and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by Malaysian law. If the above dispute resolution process fails, we both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia.</div>
